# Hop-To-It
Project 1 - Brewery locator

Proposal

Hop To It is an app that a user can interact with to find a Brewery based on their location. The user will have an option to search based on the IP address geolocation, or city. After the user searches, the app will populate a list of Breweries that are nearby. The user can then click on a brewery to get a pop up modal that gives a link to the brewery's website, a link to google maps directions, and a "tap list" generated from the taplist API.

User Story:
As a user who likes to drink beer
I want to locate a brewery with my preferences for beer and location
So I can have a good brewery experience
